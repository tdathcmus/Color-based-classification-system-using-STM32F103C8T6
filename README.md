# Color-based-classification-system-using-STM32F103C8T6
The system is built around the STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill as the main microcontroller. A TCS34725 sensor is used for color detection, while two servos handle the sorting process. Classification data is displayed on a 16x2 LCD and transmitted via an ESP32 to Google Sheets for logging. The push buttons serve two functions: the first button starts or pauses the system, and the second button resets all data.
You can check the components required in the schematic.
